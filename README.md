Setting up a local development environment
------------------------------------------

You will need to install node, npm, and the Angular CLI.
Clone the repo.
Run `npm install`
You can start the development server using `npm run serve:dev` or use `npm run e2e:serve_and_retest_on_change`, which will run the dev server and tests upon changes.


Running End-to-end tests with the development environment
------------------------------------------

`npm run e2e:serve_and_retest_on_change` will start the dev server, and run unit and E2E tests automatically upon file changes. It is useful for general local develoment.

`npm run e2e:retest_on_change` will re-run unit and E2E tests automatically upon file changes, but it needs a running server.

`npm run e2e:autorun` is good for automatically running unit and E2E tests ONCE, using an already running server.

`npm run e2e:serve_and_test` will start the dev server, and run unit and E2E headless tests once automatically and stop. It might even work in CI, producing a HTML report file and JSON file at `cypress/results/mochawesome.json` on first run.

The existing `npx ng e2e` Angular command works too, but requires clicking on the set of tests that need running. It builds and runs the server then runs E2E tests once.


Adding a "Block" (i.e. Task for the Flow editor)
--------------------------------------------------

Use the Angular CLI to scaffold a new block: `npx ng g c blocks/my-block`
Edit the generated my-block.component.ts to make it a sub-class of BaseBlock.
Take a look at one of the more recent blocks as an example, eg the AudioPlayer:

```javascript
export class AudioPlayerBlockComponent extends BaseBlockComponent {
```

There are two functions to implement to make it work:

```javascript
onConfigUpdate(config: any) {
   this.someVar = get(config, 'key', 'default value');
}

onData(data: any, firstChange: boolean) {
   // block is receiving data from the block before it in the flow
   // if you need to pass data to the next block, call emit on output 
   this.output.emit(this.model);
}
```

Implement onConfigUpdate() to modify the block state based on changes to the block configuration.
Implement onData() to respond to data being sent into the block.
Add any UI or output to the angular template for the block component.
Add any required CSS to the stylesheet for the component.
To make the block show up in the App:

- Add the component to this horrible big switch block in the BlocksWorkflowComponent [src/app/components/blocks-workflow/blocks-workflow.component.html](src/app/components/blocks-workflow/blocks-workflow.component.html)
This is needed for the flow to show up in rendered workflows.
- Add a definition, and default configuration, for the block to the block types so it can appear in the "Add Task" dialog:
[src/app/dialogs/add-block-dialog/block-types.ts](src/app/dialogs/add-block-dialog/block-types.ts)
