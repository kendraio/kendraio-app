Embedded a workflow within a workflow.

This allows composition of larger building blocks to create workflows that
are easier to manage, and DRY (don't repeat yourself).

Typical use-cases for this are creating custom form widgets that can
be referenced from a form's ``uiSchema``. Or, creating dashboards
that are made up of multiple other workflows combined with a ``multi``
multiplex workflow block.
