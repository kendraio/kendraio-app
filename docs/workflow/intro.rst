Flow Blocks
===============

Overview
--------

Flows are created by plugging together various reusable blocks of functionality.
A Flow is made from multiple blocks that connect together. A task is a running instance of a Flow.
Flows can be nested inside other Flows.
Thus, tasks are nested too, and a running task may contain multiple tasks within it.

The available “blocks” of reusable functionality are documented below.
The Flow builder in the app lets you create and customise Flows,
load existing Flows from adapters, and generate links to share Flows you have created.

Block Metadata & Comments
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Additional information can be provided about each block to help flows be better understood. 
These are general configuration properties available to all block types.

- **blockTitle** : A unique display title for this block. Appended to the generic type name in the block editor.
- **blockComment**: A descriptive comment that will be displayed above the main block editor content.
