Workflow Blocks
===============

Overview
--------

Workflows are created by plugging together various reusable blocks of functionality.
A workflow is a list of workflow items (or blocks). A task is a running instance of a workflow.
Workflow definitions can be nested, as some workflow item blocks contain embedded workflows.
Thus, tasks are nested too, and a running task may contain multiple tasks within it.

The available “blocks” of reusable functionality are documented below.
The workflow builder within the app lets you create and customise workflows,
load existing workflows from adapters, and generate links to share workflows you have created.
