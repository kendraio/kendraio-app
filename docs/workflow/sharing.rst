Sharing Flows
=================

Flows you have created can be shared with others.
There are several ways to do this.

Add to an adapter
-----------------

If you are working on an adapter, then Flows can be added to the
adapters ``configs`` folder and they will be accessible by anyone
who has your adapter installed and activated.

Use the share link
------------------

Generate a sharable link using the Flow builder share button.
This link includes and encoded version of the config, and will load
up the app directly and display the included Flow.

Export the code
---------------

You can export the JSON using the "Copy config" button. This can be
send over instant messenger, email, or your preferred mode of communication.
The receiving user then takes the JSON code and uses the "Paste config" button
within the Flow builder.
